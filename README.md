I created a daily vacation budget calculator to see how much money you’ll have every day for food and fun by using JavaScript.

I used querySelector() to select a button that activates prompts to find out my total budget, my accommodation costs, and how many days my trip is. I then used querySelector() again to target the paragraph where the calculated budget will display.

I wrote a function to collect information about my imaginary budget, accommodation costs, and the number of vacation days. I used prompt() and Number() to help collect the budget info and convert it to a number. I used a click event to run that function when the I clicked the “Calculate Daily Budget” button.

My second function I used the information I collected to calculate my daily budget for food and fun. I used the .toFixed() to round the number to two decimal places.
